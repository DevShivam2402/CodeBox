        <h1>What To Put On GitHub To Impress Potential Employers</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          When it comes to looking for a new job, a GitHub portfolio is a
          powerful tool for developers to demonstrate their skills to potential
          employers. But what should you actually put on your GitHub portfolio?
          In this post, we’ll break down the role of GitHub in a developer’s job
          search and what to put on GitHub to land your next job.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1>What Is a GitHub Portfolio?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          GitHub is a software development platform that developers use to
          create and host applications and code. One of the many ways developers
          use GitHub is as a portfolio to share samples of their work with
          potential employers. A GitHub portfolio is a repository, or repo, that
          contains a variety of files and assets — in this case, work samples.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase your technical skills and
          projects while demonstrating your qualifications for a desired role.
          While a GitHub is not a requirement for applying to most positions, it
          can provide an edge when competing against other developers for job
          openings.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1>Should You List GitHub on a Resume?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Listing your GitHub portfolio on a resume can be highly effective
          during the job search process, as it gives hiring managers a way to
          evaluate your technical and problem-solving skills after a resume
          review. It can also show that you’re an active participant in the
          software development community.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          There’s a catch, though. Developers should only consider linking to
          their GitHub if it’s active, relevant to the job description, and
          strong enough to help their candidacy. Sharing a dated, irrelevant, or
          weak portfolio won’t do your application any favors.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          The main way developers add their GitHub to their resume is linking
          specific repositories in the experience section as a way of providing
          work samples. Other potential sections to add a link to your GitHub
          include contact information, projects, professional summary, or
          technical skills.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1>Which Job Seekers Should Use GitHub as a Portfolio?</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Any developer looking to make a career change or demonstrate their
          coding skills can create a GitHub portfolio. That said, developers
          might find it helpful to build a GitHub portfolio during specific
          stages of their careers.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          It’s worth considering, though, whether building a GitHub is a good
          fit for the specific speciality you’re pursuing. Front-end and
          back-end developers, for example, might be better off building their
          own portfolio websites as that directly demonstrates their skills.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>College graduates</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Developers looking to break into the tech industry should consider
          using GitHub to demonstrate their skills. Top development jobs can be
          competitive, so any leg up will be helpful during the job search.
          Because college graduates often have limited work experience, having a
          portfolio to demonstrate qualifications, technical skills, and
          projects can prove an effective way to stand out while breaking into
          the tech industry.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Bootcamp graduates and independent learner</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          While developers from any background can succeed in the tech industry,
          bootcamp graduates and independent learners are definitely in the
          minority. Surveys have shown that 75% of developers worldwide have a
          bachelor’s degree or high
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Because they’re starting their careers from a less-traditional career
          path, bootcamp grads and similar professionals can benefit from
          building a GitHub profile that demonstrates their real-world skills
          and qualifications. By compiling their best projects and work in a
          single place, bootcamp grads and independent learners can strengthen
          their candidacy and compete with college grads for top roles.{" "}
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Developers making a career change</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          When making a career change to a different specialization, even
          experienced developers will need to demonstrate an aptitude for the
          new skills they’ll use on the job. For example, an experienced
          back-end developer looking to shift to full-stack development might
          build a portfolio that represents their growing competency in
          front-end skills and technologies. Another potential reason an
          experienced developer might create a GitHub is to demonstrate skill in
          an additional language or technology that’s relevant to their career
          path but not used in their current job.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1>What Employers look for in a GitHub Portfolio</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>
          The approach an employer takes to evaluate a portfolio can vary widely
          depending on the responsibilities, industry, and seniority of a
          position. That said, there are commonalities in the evaluation
          criteria you can anticipate when building your GitHub profile.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Code performance & program optimization</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Code performance is the ability of a program to accomplish a function
          or provide a solution to a problem. Program optimization is the
          process of enhancing a system to function more efficiently. Put
          simply, does the code function the way it should? And does the code
          use the most optimal solution to perform that function?
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Some of the factors a hiring manager might use to evaluate a
          candidate’s code performance include:
        </p>
        <br/>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Rendering performance</li>
          <li>2. Annotation load performance</li>
          <li>3. Text parsing performance</li>
          <li>4. Text parsing performance</li>
          <li>5. Efficient algorithms and data structures</li>
          <li>6. Solution run time</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h2>Code quality</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          While there are a variety of factors employers use to evaluate
          portfolios, one they’re sure to evaluate is code quality. How well
          written is the code in your portfolio? Code quality is a subjective
          assessment of whether the code is clean, error-free, and written to
          address both present and future technical requirements.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Readability & documentation</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Developers looking for roles on technical teams need to be able to
          create clear, readable, and well-documented code to succeed.
          Demonstrating this skill in a portfolio shows employers that you’re
          able to translate your work experience to a collaborative environment.
          This means that, at a minimum, your repo should include a read-me page
          explaining the purpose of the work and documentation on how to run the
          code.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Range & variety</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          When reviewing a portfolio, potential employers are trying to assess
          the developer’s ability to solve technical problems with a variety of
          technologies. A portfolio that demonstrates your ability to work with
          a range of in-demand languages and frameworks will go a long way in
          strengthening your candidac
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Passion & ability to learn</h2>
        <br/>
        <p>
          A developer’s career is a journey of continuous learning and
          improvement. To succeed in a technical role, you’ll need to constantly
          upskill through on-the-job and self-directed training. Research has
          shown that 86.7 percent of developers have taught themselves a
          framework, language, or tool outside of a classroom or course. For
          developers, the ability to learn a new language is as valuable of a
          skill as existing expertise. A strong, active GitHub with a diverse
          range of projects signals to employers that the developer they hire
          today will continue to grow and become more valuable to the company
          over time.
