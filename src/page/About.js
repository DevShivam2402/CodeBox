              <strong>üëã CodeBox is a social development environment</strong>.
              At its heart, it allows you to write code in the browser, and see
              the results of it as you build. A useful and liberating online
              code editor for developers of any skill, and particularly
              empowering for people learning to code. We focus primarily on
              front-end languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and preprocessing
              syntaxes that turn into those things.

              <strong>We say social</strong>, because CodeBox is a community.
              Most creations on CodePen are public and open source. They are
              living things that other people and the community can interact
              with, from a simple hearting, to leaving a comment, to forking and
              changing for their own needs.

              prototyping new ideas, reduced test cases for bugs, sending

              inspiration. People also use CodeBox as a sort of resume and
